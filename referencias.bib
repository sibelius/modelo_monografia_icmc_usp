  abstract = { We investigate random walks on complex networks and derive an exact
	expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) between two nodes.
	We introduce for each node the random walk centrality $C$, which
	is the ratio between its coordination number and a characteristic
	relaxation time, and show that it determines essentially the MFPT.
	The centrality of a node determines the relative speed by which a
	node can receive and spread information over the network in a random
	process. Numerical simulations of an ensemble of random walkers moving
	on paradigmatic network models confirm this analytical prediction.},

	Such techniques include integral transforms, construction of algebraic
	moments and the use of structured neural networks. In all cases we
	assume that the nature of the invariance group is known a priori.
	Many of the methods described apply to specific geometrical transformation
	groups; however some of the techniques are highly general and applicable
	to large classes of invariance groups. We also review some results
	regarding the existence and structure of invariants under certain
	kinds of groups.}
